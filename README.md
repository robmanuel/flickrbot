# flickrbot
A no context flickr bot that posts random photos from a user ID

install and then edit the right API junk into the top

run on the command line or stick into a cronjob with 

phython flickrbot.py -id paul_clarke -nocontext

ID being the flickr username and if you don't add the -nocontext bit it adds some ugly text saying the title and the URL. I prefer it clean
