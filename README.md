# flickrbot
A no context flickr bot that posts random photos from a user ID

EXAMPLE:
https://twitter.com/paulclarkephoto

Install and then edit the API keys into botini.py

Run on the command line or stick into a cronjob with 

phython flickrbot.py -id [user] -tag [search for a tag] -nocontext

ID being the flickr username and if you don't add the -nocontext bit it adds some ugly text saying the title and the URL. I prefer it clean.

This is a School of Bots production - i.e. I will hang out with you on Zoom and build a bot with your for you education and a small bit of cash for me.
